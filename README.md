## Cover illustration
I love ```object-fit:cover``` â€” it's a cheat code for any mobile design featuring artwork or photography. 

### SVG illustration
I started with paper and pencil, then scanned the illustration onto my iPad and finished it in Adobe Draw. I then exported it to Adobe Illustrator and worked with the layers there.
