# Using Gatsby
[Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is a static site generator for React. Speed + SEO were my primary concerns so it only made sense. I'm not yet taking advantage of GraphQL but perhaps I will in the future if I ever started a blog. 

# Features
## Cover illustration
I love ```object-fit:cover``` â€” it's a cheat code for any mobile design featuring artwork or photography. 

### SVG illustration
I started with paper and pencil, then scanned the illustration onto my iPad and finished it in Adobe Draw. I then exported it to Adobe Illustrator and worked with the layers there.
