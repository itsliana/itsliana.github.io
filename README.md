# React
I originally threw this site together with Gatsby.js, mainly because I wanted to try it. I then realized it made no sense since I wasn't using routing or taking advantange of GraphQL. So I converted it to a normal React app, which only took a couple hours.

# SVG illustration
I started with paper and pencil, then scanned the illustration onto my iPad and finished it in Adobe Draw. I then exported it to Adobe Illustrator and worked with the layers there. 

I love ```object-fit:cover``` â€” it's a cheat code for any mobile design featuring artwork or photography.
